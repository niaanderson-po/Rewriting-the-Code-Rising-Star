# Neetcode Blind 75 â€“ RTC Rising Star

This repository contains my personal solutions, notes, and strategies for the [Neetcode Blind 75](https://neetcode.io/practice) data structure and algorithm problems, completed as part of the **Rewriting the Code (RTC) Rising Star Program**.

## About the Program

**Rewriting the Code (RTC)** is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that empowers women and nonbinary individuals in tech to thrive and lead. The **RTC Rising Star Program** is a selective summer initiative focused on interview preparation, DSA mastery, and professional development through community, accountability, and expert-curated learning.

This project is part of RTCâ€™s **Recruiting Ramp Up** â€” a structured summer prep using the **Neetcode Blind 75**, designed to build strong problem-solving skills and confidence for technical interviews.
